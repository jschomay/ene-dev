## [The Curse of the Tech Demo](curse-of-the-tech-demo/)

This is the original demo story that I made for my ElmConf presentation.  It demonstrates all of the v1.0.0 features and lasts for about 5 minutes.  I had the audience play through it live, which was very well received (see the [recorded presentation](http://youtube.com/watch?v=t8RSxzpw1Yw)).

The client source code for this story is [available](https://github.com/jschomay/elm-interactive-story-starter/tree/149e32bfb8fb89b577d49300477a02aac614ed31/src).
