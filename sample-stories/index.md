## [The Mystery of the Missing Marbles](mystery-of-the-missing-marbles/)

A silly sample story demonstrating version 2.0.0 of the Elm Narrative Engine.  It features progressive narration (try clicking on the same thing more than once), story rollback (you can "undo" or "go back" to an earlier point in the story history), and the source demonstrates the new rules syntax.

It also features a branching narration with multiple ways to complete the story and two different endings :).

The client source code for this story is [available](https://github.com/jschomay/elm-interactive-story-starter/tree/2.0.0/src).

## [The Curse of the Tech Demo](curse-of-the-tech-demo/)

This is the original demo story that I made for my ElmConf presentation.  It demonstrates all of the v1.0.0 features and lasts for about 5 minutes.  I had the audience play through it live, which was very well received (see the [recorded presentation](http://youtube.com/watch?v=t8RSxzpw1Yw)).

The client source code for this story is [available](https://github.com/jschomay/elm-interactive-story-starter/tree/1.0.0/src).
